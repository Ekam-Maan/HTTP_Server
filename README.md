# HTTP_Server
this is a http server that serves the http requests (GET and POST only)
this server serves multiple requests at a time 
this servers also checks that two clients donot write at time and if a client is writing then no other client can read
but it allows more clients to read at same time
i used siglton design pattern 
I used Junit to test some of the functinalities such as parsing the request
